# Go Get Better

This repository contains the solutions for the exercises contained in the
`go get better` training course. The solutions are found under the relevant
branch (for example `git checkout exercise-1`, or just select the branch from
within GitHub).

## Exercise 1

Create a program that will perform 'FizzBuzz'. The rules for this are:

  * For the numbers 1 to 100
  * If a number is divisible by 3 output Fizz
  * If a number is divisible by 5 output Buzz
  * If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 output FizzBuzz
  * Otherwise output the number
  
If you've not got your Go environment set up just yet you can do this exercise
in the [Go Playground][playground]
  
## Alternative solutions

A couple of _joke_ alternative solutions are also provided. These are runnable
tests and highlight how to write testable examples.
