# Go Get Better

This repository contains the solutions for the exercises contained in the
`go get better` training course. The solutions are found under the relevant
branch (for example `git checkout exercise-1`, or just select the branch from
within GitHub).

## Exercise 4

Turn your 'FizzBuzz' solution into one that returns an error if it's passed a
negative number. 

  * Your Function should take a number for the number of iterations
  * Your function should return an error if that number is less than 0
  * Your function should return a string containing the FizzBuzz sequence
  
> Feel free to reuse your code from exercise 3.
  
## Hints

  * The function signature will be `FizzBuzz(n int) (string, error)`
