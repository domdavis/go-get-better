# Go Get Better

This repository contains the solutions for the exercises contained in the
`go get better` training course. The solutions are found under the relevant
branch (for example `git checkout exercise-1`, or just select the branch from
within GitHub).

## Generator Template

This code is an implementation of a generator that will produce sequences. The
code and tests are all written, however, the `FizzBuzz` function has not been
completed. Adapt your code to finish the `FizzBuzz` function and cause the 
failing tests to pass.

## Running The Tests

To run the tests from the command line:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Or, for more verbose output and coverage information:

```bash
go test -v -covermode=count ./...
```

A [Makefile](Makefile) is included with some basic targets for testing, as well
as perform a check of the code using tools like [golangci-lint][linter] for full
code analysis. These are not required for the course and can be ignored.
